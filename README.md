### ðŸš€ **About Me**

Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast with a deep passion for LLMs, AI agents, and intelligent systems. Iâ€™ve worked on a bunch of projects ranging from personal experiments to full-fledged ML/DL applicationsâ€”using Python, JavaScript, MySQL, and frameworks like Hugging Face, LangChain, and TensorFlow and more...

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building and deploying scalable AI agents that arenâ€™t just cool demos but actually solve real problems. Always learning and always experimenting!
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me producing music or sound designing. ðŸ™ƒ
